# Lesson 17 – Eight LED with 74HC595

## 📘 Overview
In this lesson, I learned how to use a shift register and how to handle multiple LEDs without directly connecting to output pins.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3 Board × 1
- LED × 8
- 220 ohm resistors × 8
- M-M wires × 14
- 74hc595 IC × 1

## 🎥 Demo Video
A short demo showing the actual behavior of the project on real hardware.

## 📝 Notes
### ✅ What I Learned
- How to use a shift register and handle LEDs with it.
- How to use 'bitSet' function.

### ⚠️ Error faced
- At first it didn't work as I expected and I guessed it was the problem with codes, but actually it was a connection problem.
